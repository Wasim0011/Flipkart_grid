EVEREST

Garam Masala

Mixed Masala Powder
ओवरेस्ट

गरम मसाला

SIMPLE STEPS TO AROMATIC GARAM MASALA DISHES

Prepare the dal or vegetables of your choice with usual spices in ghes/oll as you normally do.

Add 1 tsp Everest Garam Masala to 500 g vegetables or I litre ready dal. Adjust according to quantity and stir on low flame for 3 min.

Keep covered for at least 5 min. Serve warm with rice/roti for incomparable flavour. Samosa, potato vada, kachori, usal, pattice, patra and all types of farsans taste best with Everest Garam Masala.

हमेशा की तरह पी/तेल में सामान्य मसालों के साथ दाल या अपनी पसंद की सन्डियाँ बना लीजिए

500 ग्राम सब्जी या 1 लीटर तैयार दाल में 1/2 चम्मच ओवरेस्ट गरम मसाला डालें. मात्रा के अनुसार तालमेल बिठाएँ और धीमी आंच पर 3 मिनट तक हिलाएँ.

कम से कम 5 मिनट बैंक कर रखें. लाजवाब स्वाद के लिए चावल /रोटी के साथ गर्मागर्म परोसे. समोसा, आलू वड़ा, कचौरी, उसल, पेटिस, पात्रा और सभी प्रकार के फरसाण का स्वाद ओवरेस्ट गरम मसाला से बेहतरीन हो जाता है.
